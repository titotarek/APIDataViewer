# My React and Next.js Project

This project is built with React and Next.js, utilizing various features and technologies to create a dynamic and efficient web application.

## Overview

- **React and Next.js**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next.js, a React framework that simplifies the development of server-rendered React applications.
